MetaGame is a decentralized Web3 community project that blends social coordination with game-like mechanics. I worked on the design and frontend for several key areas, including the onboarding experience, visual style, and community tools.

My contributions included improving layout, styling and accessibility across pages, refactoring React components, and helping maintain visual consistency. I also collaborated with other contributors on content structure and contributed to the MetaGame Wiki for documentation. The project was fully open-source and driven by a global contributor network.
