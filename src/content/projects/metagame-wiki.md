The MetaGame Wiki was my first venture into the Web3 space, where I started as a contributor by picking up and resolving open issues on GitHub. What began as casual contributions quickly evolved into a more active role, and before long, I stepped up to become an admin and maintainer for the project.

In this role, I was responsible for keeping both the codebase and the content of the site up-to-date. I handled everything from fixing bugs and merging contributor pull requests, to coordinating with writers and contributors who regularly added new playbooks and educational content for the Web3 community.

One of the highlights of this project was leading a full redesign of the wiki in 2021, which improved the user experience and provided a more consistent and accessible structure for the growing body of content. Alongside the technical work, I spent considerable time mentoring non-technical contributors — helping them learn Git, guiding them through the pull request process, and enabling them to take a more active role in the project’s development.

In addition to maintaining the platform, I personally authored several playbooks, contributing directly to the knowledge base that supported the wider Web3 community. This project gave me the opportunity to blend hands-on technical work with community building, mentoring, and collaborative open-source development within a fast-evolving space.
