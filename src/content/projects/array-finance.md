Array Finance aimed to simplify DeFi investing by enabling users to create and invest in trusted, user-curated portfolios. I was contracted through RaidGuild, a decentralised freelance collective, to design and build a fast, modern landing site to promote the protocol during its launch phase.

### Scope of Work

#### Site Build & Architecture
Developed a 4-page static site using Gatsby to support Array’s early marketing efforts. Key sections included project overview, team, roadmap, and a community call-to-action. The CCO page had a little blockchain interaction as it showed the total funds received in the coin offering.

#### Component-Based Design
Leveraged React and ThemeUI to implement a fully responsive, design-token-based layout aligned with the brand’s futuristic visual identity.

#### UX Enhancements
Integrated React Spring for subtle animations and interactions, creating a polished and engaging user experience.

#### Hosting & Optimisation
Deployed the site via Netlify, ensuring rapid load times and seamless performance across devices.

### Postscript
Although Array Finance ultimately didn’t continue—reportedly due to a contract vulnerability—the project remains a strong example of delivering production-ready frontend assets in a lean, fast-moving Web3 environment.
