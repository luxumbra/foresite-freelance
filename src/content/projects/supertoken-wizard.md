The SuperToken Contracts Wizard is a web application to interactively build a smart contract out of components from Superfluid's Supertoken Smart Contracts.

The user selects the kind of contract that they want, set parameters and desired features, and the Wizard will generate all of the code necessary. The resulting code is ready to be compiled and deployed, or it can serve as a starting point and customized further with application specific logic. From the app you can copy the raw code, compile it & copy the artefacts and even deploy it to a a range of blockchain networks.

## My involvement
Working as a freelancer for Hunters Workshop, I contributed to improvements to the user interface, fixed bugs and improved user experience by adding toasts to provide user feedback when actions completed or errors occured. I also added additional functionality to the app.

The site was deployed to Netlify using continuous delivery workflow from Github. The backend was in a separate repository and hosted on an encrypted remote server running Node.js. I was responsible for all UI improvements and setting up of the hosting for both front and back ends.

## Postscript
Unfortunately, the project is no longer live and the backend services were not maintained, so all that remains is the staging environment which is hosted on my own domain and deployed to my Netlify account.
