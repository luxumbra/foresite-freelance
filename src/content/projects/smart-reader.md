SmartReader is an AI-powered tool designed to help users analyze, understand, and interpret smart contracts using natural language processing (NLP). By leveraging AI, SmartReader simplifies complex smart contract structures, making them more accessible to developers, auditors, and non-technical users.

## Contributions & Tech Stack

As a freelance frontend developer, I contributed to this project by:

- Optimizing the UI for a seamless user experience
- Enhancing responsiveness & UI components for better accessibility
- Fixing bugs related to searching for smart contracts and third-party services

Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Chakra UI,

Blockchain Integration: Web3.js, Ethers.js

AI & NLP: OpenAI API (or equivalent) for smart contract interpretation

Deployment & Hosting: Github and Vercel

## Project Impact & Use Cases

- Developers & Auditors – Quickly interpret smart contract logic using AI-powered insights
- Non-Technical Users – Understand blockchain contracts without needing Solidity expertise
- Crypto Startups & DAOs – Enhance contract transparency and security audits

## Final Thoughts

I was responsible for frontend development, ensuring the UI was intuitive, fast, and accessible while integrating Web3 functionality. SmartReader is a powerful tool for anyone working with blockchain contracts, bridging the gap between technical complexity and user-friendly interpretation.
