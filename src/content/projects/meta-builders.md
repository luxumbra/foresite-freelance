I was tasked with the design and build of the MetaBuilders website, a marketing and information site for a Web3 agency and community of skilled freelancers. The project involved creating a modern, responsive layout that effectively communicated the brand's values and offerings and enabled users to purchase services as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

The website was built using Vite, React, Typescript and TailwindCSS and hosted on Vercel, using Thirdweb's smart contracts for NFT minting and management.
