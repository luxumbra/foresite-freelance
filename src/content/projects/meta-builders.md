I led the design and development of the Meta-Builders website—a marketing platform for a Web3 agency and a global community of skilled freelancers, from project managers to illustrators, designers and developers. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and responsive site that clearly conveyed the brand’s ethos and service offerings, while integrating Web3 functionality to support service purchases as NFTs.

Built with Vite, React, TypeScript, blockchain technology and TailwindCSS, the site delivers a fast and fluid user experience across all devices. It is deployed on Vercel for scalable performance. Blockchain functionality was implemented using [Thirdweb’s](https://thirdweb.com/) smart contracts, allowing users to mint and manage service-based NFTs directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
