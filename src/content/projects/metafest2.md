I built and deployed the official website for MetaFest2, an online Web3 conference hosted by MetaGame DAO. The project combined interactive visuals with functional integrations to support the live event and create an engaging experience for attendees.

## Scope of work
- Creative frontend development using NextJS, React Three Fiber, ChakraUI and the Google Calendar API.
- Designed and implemented a fully interactive 3D experience with animated starfields, easter eggs, NFT minting and subtle motion effects.
- Enable users of the site to join events via Discord and CryptoVoxels without having to leave the website.
- Integrated Google Calendar API to allow organisers to manage the conference schedule in real-time without redeploying the site.

### Creative frontend development
The site was developed using NextJS, React Three Fiber, ChakraUI, and the Google Calendar API. The stack was chosen to balance performance, flexibility, and the ability to deliver complex interactive features directly in the browser.

### 3D experience and animation
Designed and implemented a fully interactive 3D environment featuring animated starfields, hidden easter eggs, NFT minting features, and smooth motion effects. React Three Fiber enabled the delivery of a visually rich experience while maintaining performance and responsiveness across devices.

### Seamless event participation
Integrated links and functionality allowing users to join live events via Discord and CryptoVoxels directly from the site, eliminating the need to navigate away from the main conference platform and creating a more cohesive user journey.

### Dynamic schedule management
Integrated the Google Calendar API to allow event organisers to update the conference schedule in real-time. This ensured attendees always had access to the latest event information without requiring site redeployment or developer involvement.

## Outcome
The final product delivered a visually rich and interactive experience tailored to the MetaGame community and the Web3 audience. The 3D elements and dynamic schedule integration created a seamless experience for attendees, while giving organisers flexibility to adapt the event schedule on the fly. Although the site is no longer live following the event, it remains a strong example of my ability to combine creative development, live data integration, and immersive user experience design.
