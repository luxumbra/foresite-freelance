Built and deployed the official website for MetaFest2, an online Web3 conference hosted by MetaGame DAO. The site was developed using NextJS, React Three Fiber, ChakraUI and integrated with Google calendar. Unfortunately, the site is no longer live as the event has passed, but it was a significant project that showcased my skills in creative development.

I implemented a visually stunning 3D experience that included a galaxy of starfields, easter eggs (hidden goodies) and other animated features and to support a dynamic and evolving schedule, I integrated the Google Calendar API.
