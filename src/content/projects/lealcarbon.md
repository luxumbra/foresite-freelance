title: LEALcarbon Sustainability App
---

Contracted to lead the UX and UI design for LEALcarbon, a sustainability-focused web app aimed at both individuals and corporate users. The app was designed to gamify carbon reduction and eco-conscious decision-making, with tailored user journeys for different user types.

Over the course of the project, I worked in Figma and FigJam to deliver:

  - User flows and interaction diagrams
  - Wireframes and page layouts
  - User stories and experience maps
  - High-fidelity visual designs with modular components

The interface was designed to be clean, accessible, and modern, with clear incentives and feedback loops for both casual users and enterprise-level sustainability reporting. While the project ultimately did not proceed to development, the full UX and visual design system was completed and handed off for implementation.
