<!-- Contracted to lead the UX and UI design for a sustainability-focused web app aimed at both individuals and corporate users. The app was designed to gamify carbon reduction and eco-conscious decision-making, with tailored user journeys for different user types.

Over the course of the project, I worked in Figma and FigJam to deliver:

  - User flows and interaction diagrams
  - User stories
  - Wireframes and page layouts
  - High-fidelity visual designs with modular components

I created a component library in Figma to improve workflow and maintainability of the design files and make updating designs more efficient.

The interface was designed to be clean, accessible, and modern, with clear incentives and feedback loops for both casual users and enterprise-level sustainability reporting and featured illustrations created by another team member. While the project ultimately did not proceed to development, the full UX and visual design system was completed and handed off for implementation. -->

I was contracted to lead the UX and UI design for a sustainability-focused web application aimed at helping both individuals and businesses make more eco-conscious decisions. The app’s concept centred around gamifying carbon reduction, encouraging users to engage with sustainability goals through clear incentives and actionable feedback.

## Design Process
My role covered the entire design process, from early discovery through to a fully-developed design system, using Figma and FigJam throughout. I collaborated closely with stakeholders to map out user journeys tailored to different audience segments — from casual users looking to track personal impact, to enterprise users requiring detailed sustainability reporting.

## Key Deliverables

- Detailed user flows and interaction diagrams to map out user behaviour and app logic
- Comprehensive user stories to capture requirements and guide feature design
- Low- and high-fidelity wireframes to iterate on layout and functionality
- High-fidelity visual designs, built around a modular component system for consistency and scalability
- To streamline the workflow and ensure maintainability, I created a reusable component library within Figma, which allowed for more efficient design updates and easier handoff to development.

## Outcome
The interface was crafted to be clean, accessible, and highly usable, blending clear visual hierarchy with engaging illustrations (created by a collaborating designer) to support the app’s mission. Although the project ultimately did not move forward into development, a complete UX strategy, full visual design system, and developer-ready design assets were successfully delivered and prepared for potential future implementation.
