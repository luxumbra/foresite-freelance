I set up my own crafting business early 2025 ater years of on and off tinkering and was obviously in need of a brand; a logo, business cards, domain name, etc, etc followed. First came the name, something that resonated with who I am, what I create and what is important to me. After some mulling of ideas, I came up with Bough & Burrow - The bough of a tree, the burrow of a badger. The Bough part relates to my materials while the burrow symbolises my studio and my heart...where i feel at home.

Next came the logo. It had to represent my business but also the heart behind the business -- Me. It features a strong tree, an oak to be specific, as the main focal point. I've always had a love of badgers, so a badger slumbers in a burrow beneath the tree. We have a full-moon and shooting star over Glastonbury Tor, a huge part of my late teens - I grew up with a view of the Tor out of my bedroom window. Initially sketched in my art pad, imported to Figma then overlaying vector paths on my sketch and teaking until i was 100% happy. Once i was content with the logo, I began working on the business card designs. Using some of my sketches to add a touch of whimsy to the cards and a QR code which gives anyone scanning it 15% off in my etsy store ([https://bghbrrw.uk/etsy](https://bghbrrw.uk/etsy)). URL shortening and QR codes are provided by the excellent Short.io which is an awesome service. The cards were printed by Moo.com and have turned out wonderfully.

I've also had a custom branding iron made with my logo so i can brand my products.
