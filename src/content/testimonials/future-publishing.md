Dave was a rock - dependable, self-motivated and crucially a calm and patient mentor for less experienced team members. Dave has a passion and pride in doing the right thing, and not just what is expedient and this had a real impact on the quality of the products we were building. If the opportunity presented itself I would not hesitate hiring him again.
