      "Built and deployed the official website for MetaFest: Croatia, a Web3 community event hosted by MetaGame DAO. The site was developed using Astro and TailwindCSS, and optimised for speed and clarity with static site generation.\n\nTo support a dynamic and evolving schedule, I integrated the Google Calendar API via a custom Node.js backend, hosted securely on an encrypted remote server and managed with PM2. The backend fetched updated schedule data every minute, automatically triggering a rebuild and redeploy of the static frontend, ensuring attendees always saw the most up-to-date speaker and event information.\n\nThe site also featured dual-mode ecommerce integration: attendees could purchase tickets via a Croatian card processor or using crypto through a wallet connection. Both flows were designed to offer a consistent and user-friendly experience, regardless of payment method.",
